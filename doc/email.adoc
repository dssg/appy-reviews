= Email with Appy
:toc:

[TIP]
====
Email has been automated via cron in the Elastic Beanstalk cluster.

Nonetheless, careful review of the email crontab is necessary each year, to ensure that it is suited to current expectations.

For that reason, the cron email command features a "year check." The command checks the environment variable `YEAR_CHECK` against the current year (_e.g._ `2022`); if the flag `--force|-f` is not supplied, and the environment variable does not match the current year, the command will not execute.

Having verified the email crontab, the `YEAR_CHECK` variable may be set to the current year via the crontab itself.

And, the below documentation is suggested background material for understanding Appy emails and their crontab.

See: link:../.ebextensions/cron-leader.config[cron-leader.config].

[NOTE]
====
As of yet, there is no argcmdr `manage` command for execution of these, (unlike with ETL). As such, these commands require a locally-running development container:

    manage develop

(But! It's not hard to add such commandsâ€¦.)

== Pre-deadline Reminders

=== Testing

It is a very good idea to test commands, first, to check:

* email content and rendering (with test targets)
* loaded data (with dry runs)
* programming & human logic (with all the above)

TIP: You can find archived SQL queries and tips for auditing these commands in link:./query/[query].

Notify *applicants* with *incomplete applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder -v2 [--dry-run] --test "Liz Lemon <lizlemon@gmail.com>" --test "Ralph Garmand <ralphgarmand@gmail.com>" applicant

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder -v2 --dry-run applicant

Remind _all_ *recommenders* (whether reference submitted or not) -- (we *didn't* do this in 2020):

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder -v2 [--dry-run] --test "Liz Lemon <lizlemon@gmail.com>" --test "Ralph Garmand <ralphgarmand@gmail.com>" --test "Lizzz Lemon <lizlemon+another@gmail.com>" reference

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --test-email lizlemon@gmail.com --test-email lizlemon+ref1@gmail.com --test-email ralphgarmand+ref2@gmail.com [--dry-run] --references

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --dry-run --references

=== Execution

What we actually did/do.

Notify *applicants* with *incomplete applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder [-v2] applicant

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --references


== Post-deadline Status

=== Testing

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references* for *completed applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --references --references-late --references-complete [--dry-run] [--test-email ...]

Notify *applicants* with *completed applications* that we've *received less than two references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus -v2 --unsubmitted [--dry-run] [--test-email ...]

=== Execution

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references* for *completed applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus -v2 --references --references-late --references-complete

Notify *applicants* with *completed applications* that we've *received less than two references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus -v2 --unsubmitted


== Interview Assignments

Notify *interviewers* & *interviewees* of extant & unnnotified *interview assignments*:

    manage develop djmanage sendinterview [--dry-run] [--test-email ...]
