Dear {{ applicant.first_name }} {{ applicant.last_name }},

Congratulations! You have been shortlisted for the {{ round_ordinal }} interview round of the Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship of {{program_year}}. We were overwhelmed and excited by the interest in our program and received nearly 1,000 applications this year. It was wonderful to see so many people with excellent and diverse backgrounds passionate about making a social impact.

Each of the applications were typically reviewed by 3 reviewers and you have made it to the interview round. You should be very proud of your work so far and we look forward to talking with you. We will be conducting these interviews via Zoom (or another videoconference tool) over the next week or so.

We have recruited mentors and fellows from previous years to help us with the interviews. You have been matched with {{ interviewer.first_name }} {{ interviewer.last_name }}, {% if interviewer.association %}{{ interviewer.association }}, {% endif %}CC'd for your interview. They will be contacting you to schedule an interview. Please reach out to them if you don't hear from them and also feel free to let us know if you're having trouble connecting with them so we can help.

About the interview: Please allocate about an hour for the interview and find a quiet place with good internet access and a computer. Among other things, the interview will include reviewing and discussing code that you've written. Please make sure that you send to the interviewer or are ready to show (via screenshare) a substantial piece of code (ideally in Python) that you've written. This is not a coding test and there will be no live coding exercises. We want to assess your programming and data analysis experience in order to select the right mix of fellows for the summer.

Bear in mind that your interviewer may not be able to answer all your questions about this year's fellowship (project details, start dates, etc.) since they may not be intimately involved with planning for this summer. Feel free to email us any questions they can't answer and we'll be happy to answer them, and be patient with us as we make decisions and get back to you after the interviews.

Again, congratulations on being shortlisted. We're excited to move on to the first round of interviews and look forward to talking with you.

Regards,
