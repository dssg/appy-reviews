We got around 750 applications this year and we’re looking to get 3 reviews for each application. Around 80 of you volunteered to help us, which means ~30 application reviews for each reviewer. We're estimating the total time commitment to be 5-6 hours per person. Of course, we'd love it if you could do more than 30.

Appy

This year we will be using, Appy, the same home built application review system as last couple of years. Appy will successively show you prioritized applications to review. Once you have submitted your review, Appy will automatically fetch the next one for you, and increment your total reviewed application count at the top of the page. You can review as many applications as you want. You can see all the applications you’ve reviewed, and update your reviews, by going back to your dashboard at {{ domain }}.

Timeline

We would really appreciate it if you could finish this first round of application reviews by February 11, so you can celebrate National Make A Friend Day (or the Satisfied Staying Single Day) without any guilt. We will be moving people to the interview round on a rolling basis; so, the sooner you submit your reviews, the sooner we are able schedule interviews. Our goal is to finish the first round of interviews by Feb 28, the final round interviews by March 10, and make decisions by March 15.

Reviewing Tips

 - As you all know, we look for a balance of skills. You don't have to be the best programmer or machine learning person but you also can't know any coding or data analysis. We do use Python so someone coming in with no python skills would struggle. By rating people carefully across skills, we can make sure we get the right mix across the fellows.

 - If there is enough information in the application to determine the level of a skill, please try to give a judgement. Only use '?' if there isn't enough information to assses that skill.

 - It's difficult to say no, especially when we review applicants who look like wonderful people, care about the world, and are passionate about DSSG. If they're not prepared for DSSG, the outcome isn't good for anyone. Please flag those candidates in your comments - we typically send a special email to them encouraging them to pick up specific skills and apply again.

Several folks have asked to be recused from reviewing people they know. If you don’t want to review someone, simply skip them. If you do know someone who has applied, please tell us what you think about them and if they would be a good fit. All of you know DSSG and what we look for. We want you to use that knowledge and your impression of the applicant to help us.
