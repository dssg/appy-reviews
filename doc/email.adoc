[NOTE]
====
As of yet, there is no argcmdr `manage` command for execution of these, (unlike with ETL). As such, these commands require a locally-running development container:

    manage develop

(But! It's not hard to add such commandsâ€¦.)

== Pre-deadline Reminders

=== Testing

It is a very good idea to test commands, first, to check:

* email content and rendering (with test targets)
* loaded data (with dry runs)
* programming & human logic (with all the above)

TIP: You can find archived SQL queries and tips for auditing these commands in link:./query/[query].

Notify *applicants* with *incomplete applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder -v2 [--dry-run] --test "Liz Lemon <lizlemon@gmail.com>" --test "Ralph Garmand <ralphgarmand@gmail.com>" applicant

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder -v2 --dry-run applicant

Remind _all_ *recommenders* (whether reference submitted or not) -- (we *didn't* do this in 2020):

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder -v2 [--dry-run] --test "Liz Lemon <lizlemon@gmail.com>" --test "Ralph Garmand <ralphgarmand@gmail.com>" --test "Lizzz Lemon <lizlemon+another@gmail.com>" reference

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --test-email lizlemon@gmail.com --test-email lizlemon+ref1@gmail.com --test-email ralphgarmand+ref2@gmail.com [--dry-run] --references

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --dry-run --references

=== Execution

What we actually did/do.

Notify *applicants* with *incomplete applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendreminder [-v2] applicant

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --references


== Post-deadline Status

=== Testing

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references* for *completed applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus --references --references-late --references-complete [--dry-run] [--test-email ...]

Notify *applicants* with *completed applications* that we've *received less than two references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus -v2 --unsubmitted [--dry-run] [--test-email ...]

=== Execution

Notify *recommenders* with *unsubmitted references* for *completed applications*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus -v2 --references --references-late --references-complete

Notify *applicants* with *completed applications* that we've *received less than two references*:

    manage develop djmanage sendstatus -v2 --unsubmitted


== Interview Assignments

Notify *interviewers* & *interviewees* of extant & unnnotified *interview assignments*:

    manage develop djmanage sendinterview [--dry-run] [--test-email ...]
