We received nearly 1,000 applications this year and we're looking to get at least 3 reviews for each application. Around 60 of you volunteered to help us, which means ~50 application reviews from each reviewer. We're estimating the total time commitment to be 5-6 hours per person. Of course, we'd love it if you could do as many more than 50 as you can.

* Appy *

This year we will be using Appy, the same home-built application review system as we have the last couple of years. Appy will successively show you prioritized applications to review. Once you have submitted your review, Appy will automatically fetch the next one for you, and increment your total reviewed application count at the top of the page. You can review as many applications as you want. You can see all the applications you've reviewed, and update your reviews, by going back to your dashboard at {{ domain }}.

* Timeline *

We would really appreciate it if you could finish this first round of application reviews by February 11th, so you can celebrate National Make A Friend Day (or the Satisfied Staying Single Day) without any guilt. We will be moving people to the interview round on a rolling basis; so, the sooner you submit your reviews, the sooner we are able to schedule interviews. Our goal is to start interviews by February 14th, finish the first round of interviews by Feb 25th, the final round interviews by March 11th, and make decisions by March 15th.

* Confidentiality *

Please keep in mind that all information in the applications is confidential and only to be used for evaluating applicants. No information from the applications should be shared outside of the application process. Because we are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive space in the DSSG summer fellowship, we have collected information from applicants about personal characteristics relating to their demographics and identity. We are sharing this information with reviewers as a part of the application process following research which shows that awareness of these attributes reduces bias, while being unaware of them can encourage it. We are trusting you to use this information appropriately and responsibly.

* Reviewing Tips *

• As you all know, we look for a balance of skills. You don't have to be the best programmer or machine learning person but you also must have experience with coding or data analysis. We do use Python so someone coming in with no Python skills would struggle. By getting reliable ratings across skills, we can make sure we get the right mix across the fellows.

• If there is enough information in the application to determine the level of a skill, please try to give a judgment. Only use '?' ("cannot determine") if there isn't enough information to asssess that skill.

• It's difficult to say no, especially when we review applicants who seem like wonderful people, care about the world, and are passionate about DSSG. But, if they're not prepared for DSSG, the outcome isn't good for anyone. Please flag those candidates in your comments – we typically send a special email to them encouraging them to pick up specific skills and apply again.

• Several folks have asked to be recused from reviewing people they know. If you don't want to review someone, simply skip them – (refresh the application review page). If you do know someone who has applied, please tell us what you think about them and if they would be a good fit. All of you know DSSG and what we look for. We want you to use that knowledge and your impression of the applicant to help us.

Thanks everyone for your help and Slack/email us if you have any questions.
